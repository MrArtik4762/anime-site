<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully developed a pure JavaScript anime catalog application integrating with the AniLiberty API. Initially, the engineer identified a discrepancy between the API endpoints specified in the problem statement and the actual working API, confirming the correct endpoints with the user. The application was then built, including , , , , and , placed in a new  directory.

Initial testing revealed critical issues: CORS errors, detail page loading failures due to incorrect API URL, and pagination breaking layout. The user provided explicit instructions for these fixes, along with recommended improvements like optimized rendering, XSS protection, and enhanced responsiveness. The engineer diligently applied all these corrections, including adding  and , fixing API endpoints, implementing container clearing for pagination, and introducing an  function. After re-testing and confirming API functionality, the engineer declared the project complete and ready for production, indicating all identified bugs were resolved.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend Development:** Pure JavaScript (ES6+, async/await), HTML5, CSS3.
-   **Web APIs:** Fetch API for HTTP requests, URLSearchParams for URL parameter parsing, DOM manipulation.
-   **Application Logic:** Client-side pagination, event handling, data rendering, error handling.
-   **Performance/UX:** Client-side caching, loading indicators, responsive design (CSS Media Queries).
-   **Security:** Basic XSS protection ( function).
-   **API Integration:** AniLiberty API v1 (RESTful endpoints).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application's overall structure is a full-stack React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database, but the new anime catalog is a standalone pure JavaScript application within a new directory.

<current_work>
The current state of the product is a fully functional, standalone anime catalog web application built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, located in the  directory.

The previous AI engineer successfully implemented:
*   **AniLiberty API Integration:** The application now correctly fetches data using the working AniLiberty API v1 endpoints ( for the catalog and  for details).
*   **Catalog Page:** Displays a grid of anime cards, featuring posters and titles. It includes a functional  selector (10/25/50 items) and pagination controls (Previous/Next). Cards are clickable and navigate to the detail page.
*   **Detail Page:** Shows comprehensive anime details including HD poster, description, year, type, status, episodes, rating, genres, and view statistics.
*   **Critical Fixes Applied:**
    *   **CORS:** All  requests now include  and appropriate  (, ) to ensure cross-origin requests function correctly.
